# Introduction

This guide has three purposes:

1. Set the expectations for data visualization at the California Policy Lab
2. Provide adaptable code templates that reflect the expectations
3. Outline the options you will need to further customize your exhibits
        
As a living document, suggestions for additions, deletions, or edits are welcome.

# Guidance for All CPL Figures

* Even in draft form figures must be easy to read and understand
* Avoid using abbreviations

## Titles and Notes

* In draft form use R to add titles and notes
* In publication form titles and notes should be added in the destination document (Word, Powerpoint) rather than in R
* Titles should be descriptive and include a figure number
* Notes should include information about the data: e.g., source, date range, sample selection, and sample size.

## Axis Formatting
* Always include descriptive axis titles
* Use a left justified Y-axis title horizontally above the axis instead of a vertical Y-axis title
* Format percentages as whole numbers with % signs, not as decimals: 10% not 0.10
* Axis titles should be bold, axis values should not

## Legend Formatting
* Use legends when two or more groups or variables are displayed
* Use variable labels instead of variable names: “Graduation Year” not “gradyr”
* In draft form place legends to the right of the figure
* In publication form, place legends within the graph if space allows, otherwise legends should remain to the right of the figure

## Race-equity Considerations
* Adopted from [The Urban Institute’s Applying Racial Equity Awareness in Data Visualization](https://osf.io/x8tbw/).
* Be purposeful in the ordering of your data; it affects how readers perceive the relationship or hierarchy between groups
* Does the study focus on a particular community? If so, present that group first
* What point are you trying to make with the data? Order the columns to reinforce it
* Consider ordering alphabetically, by population size, sample size, or effect size
